:zap: [SCFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16906) got accepted at AAAI 2025. This is the first work attempting to distill flow matching model into one and few step generation. With SCFlow, we could achieve consistent one and few step generation, which means starting from a noise, no matter how many NFEs is used for sampling, the final generated image is indentical.
