I am first-year PhD student at Rutgers University under supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7VNhCIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Distinguished Prof. Dimitris Metaxas</a>. My research focuses on generative models, specifically diffusion models and visual autoregressive models, with a primary emphasis on fundamental research. For diffusion models, I concentrate on developing efficient and robust training methodologies. Additionally, I am deeply interested in consistency model training and distillation, particularly in improving robust training techniques and addressing the weaknesses inherent in consistency distillation processes. Besides, I have recently been researching visual autoregressive models, focusing on their applications to downstream tasks such as editing and text-to-3D generation. Previously, I was a Research Resident under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYZ5ODQAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Tuan Anh Tran</a> at <a href='https://www.vinai.io/'>VinAI Research, Vietnam</a> and spent 2 wonderful years there. I received a bachelor degree in computer science from Monash University in 2020.
